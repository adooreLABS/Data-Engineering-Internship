# Data-Engineering-Internship

Stemming from my drive to build a data portfolio, I created this repo to highlight my learnings as I embark on an eight week (June - July 2019) remote internship working with contracting data and tools that make it accessible for analysis. Within the timeframe, I will build skills in:

- Data Scraping
- Data Cleaning and Analysis
- Databases
- Version Control
- Linux Command Line
- Process Documentation

**Tool kit**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Git, The Flatten tool, Tabula, Beautiful Soup, Command Line


**Data Formats**: HTML, JSON, CSV, PDF and XLS/XLSX


**Credits**: This internship would not have been possible without the guidance and support of [David Opoku](https://twitter.com/sdopoku) in designing the program, providing resources and shaping my learning curve.


**Contribution**: Support, resourses and enquiries can be directed at: j.jamilafarouk[a]gmail[.]com or [jamilafarouk_j](https://twitter.com/jamilafarouk_j)
