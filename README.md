# Data-Engineering-Internship

Stemming from my drive to build a data portfolio, I created this repo to highlight my learnings as I embark on an eight week (June - July 2019) remote internship working with contracting data and tools that make it accessible for analysis. Within the timeframe, I'll focus on:

- The Open Contracting Data Standard
- Data Scraping
- Data Cleaning 
- Databases
- Version Control
- Process Documentation  

**Tool kit**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Git, Flatten tool, Tabula, Beautiful Soup


**Data Formats**: HTML, JSON, CSV, PDF and XLS/XLSX


**Credits**: This internship would not have been possible without the guidance and support of [David Opoku](https://twitter.com/sdopoku) in providing resources and shaping my learning curve.
